## üöÄ About The Project

This project began as a clean, single-page portfolio. Over time, it has been meticulously upgraded with modern JavaScript libraries and custom code to create a memorable and interactive experience. The goal was to build a site that not only presents my skills and projects but also demonstrates a passion for creative front-end development.

The portfolio is designed to be lightweight, performant, and visually stunning, ensuring a great experience on any device.
